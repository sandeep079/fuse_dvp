        "The need for parallel and distributed algorithms in deep learning arises due to the intricate nature of neural networks, encompassing millions of parameters that necessitate vast amounts of data for effective learning. Training these models is a computationally demanding and time-consuming task. For instance, training a deep neural network like VGGNet on a single core CPU typically takes several days, highlighting the intensive nature of this process. Even when employing CPUs with multiple cores say $n$, the training time reduces to approximately $1/n$ of the original duration, which still translates to several hours, indicating the substantial time investment involved. Additionally, the sheer size of datasets often exceeds the storage capacity of a single machine. Therefore, the development of parallel and distributed algorithms becomes crucial to expedite training procedures and notably diminish the time required for these intricate deep learning tasks."
