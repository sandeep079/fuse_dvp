In contrast, **self-supervised learning (SSL)** aims to harness the abundance of **unlabeled data** by generating supervisory signals directly from the data itself. Think of it like solving a puzzle: the model learns by finding patterns in the data without being told the answers.\n","\n","**Contrastive learning** is a powerful subset of SSL that teaches models to recognize similarities and differences in data, much like how a child learns to match objects in a game. It has shown impressive results in fields like computer vision (example image classification) and natural language processing (example sentence embeddings).\n","\n","\n","<img src=\"https://amitness.com/posts/images/contrastive-find-a-pair.png\" width=\"45%\" /> &nbsp; <img src=\"https://amitness.com/posts/images/contrastive-puzzle.gif\" width=\"45%\" />\n","\n","Imagine a game where as kids, we matched a cat on the left with the same cat hidden among other animals on the right by recognizing its features. Contrastive learning mimics this process: it teaches models to bring similar items (example two images of the same cat) closer together in a feature space while pushing dissimilar items (example like a cat and a dog) farther apart. Over time, the model learns meaningful patterns without explicit labels\n","\n","**Example:** Imagine sorting a photo library. You group similar photos of the same person together while separating them from photos of others.

To address this, **Semi-Supervised Contrastive Learning (SSCL)** emerged as a natural progression—**combining the strengths of both supervised and self-supervised methods**.\n","\n","These approaches reflect the growing trend of building flexible learning paradigms that can operate across different levels of supervision, allowing models to better generalize and adapt to the data at hand.\n","\n","\n","## **Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL)**\n","\n","**Supervised Contrastive Learning** extends the standard contrastive learning paradigm by utilizing **class label information** to define positive and negative pairs more effectively.\n","\n","In SCL, for a given **anchor**, all samples **from the same class** are considered **positives**, while those from **different classes** are treated as **negatives**.
