        "## **Effect of Removing NSP: Ablation Study on MNLI and QNLI**\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)** task was introduced in the original BERT paper ([Devlin et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf)) to help the model understand relationships between sentence pairs. However, later studies and experiments questioned its necessity for achieving state-of-the-art results on various downstream tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "To investigate the contribution of the NSP task, researchers conducted **ablation studies**. An ablation study involves removing a specific component (in this case, the NSP pre-training objective) from a model to assess its impact on performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The original BERT paper presented results comparing models trained **with** and **without** the NSP objective on several tasks, including **Natural Language Inference (NLI)** tasks like **MNLI** and **QNLI**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **What are MNLI and QNLI?**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: A dataset for determining the relationship between a premise sentence and a hypothesis sentence. The task is to classify the relationship as **entailment**, **contradiction**, or **neutral**. This requires the model to understand how sentence pairs relate to each other logically.\n",
        "*   **QNLI (Question-answering Natural Language Inference)**: An NLI task derived from question-answering data. Given a question and a potential answer sentence from a text, the model must determine if the sentence contains the answer (entailment) or not (not entailment). This task also relies on understanding the relationship between a question and a potential answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "These tasks are good benchmarks for evaluating a model's ability to understand sentence-pair relationships, which is what the NSP task was designed to improve.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Ablation Study Results: With vs. Without NSP**\n",
        "\n",
        "The ablation study results on MNLI and QNLI showed:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Model Variant      | MNLI Accuracy (%) | QNLI Accuracy (%) |\n",
        "| ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- |\n",

        "\n",
        "> *Note: Values are illustrative, based on the original BERT paper's ablation findings.*\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Interpretation and Why NSP is Sometimes Removed**\n",
        "\n",
        "The results indicate that removing the NSP task resulted in a very **marginal decrease** in performance on both MNLI and QNLI. The difference was often less than 0.5%.\n",
        "\n",
        "This led to the conclusion that, while NSP might offer a slight benefit for tasks specifically requiring sentence-pair understanding, its contribution was not as significant as initially hypothesized and was considerably less impactful than the MLM task.\n",
        "\n",
        "Later models, such as **RoBERTa**, built upon this finding by completely removing the NSP pre-training task and focusing on more robust MLM training with larger datasets and longer sequences. RoBERTa achieved state-of-the-art results across many benchmarks without NSP, further supporting the idea that explicit sentence-pair pre-training might not be strictly necessary if the model learns strong contextual representations through MLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, NSP is sometimes removed because empirical evidence showed its limited impact on overall performance, and focusing solely on a strong MLM objective proved to be a more effective pre-training strategy for many downstream NLP tasks."
